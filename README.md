# blurme

blurme v1.0 Codename MEH (My Eyes Hurt) is a small script which will blur your feh set background if any window, or rofi is open. Furthermore there are some switches wich can be found, when calling 'blurme -h'. It allows setting a custom directory (-d), adding (-a) a new program, which will start the transition, setting the transition time (-t), and finally one which will draw some output (-v) to the commandline.

Please feel free to fork it, make pull requests and use it in your own projects.

This is my first project i publish. Please be gentle on me :)
